		"it does not allow the distance (in days) between them to be less than N. If you specify N=1, then this "
		"constraint means that no two activities can be scheduled in the same day. N=2 means that each two activities "

	s+=tr("Q: Are some constraints more efficient in speed of generation than other constraints, even if they give the same result?\n\n"
		"A: From the way the algorithm is conceived, the automatic generation is faster if you use students set (or teacher) not available "
		"and/or constraint activity(ies) preferred time slots or constraint activity preferred starting time to specify impossible slots, "
		"in addition to possible use of students (set) or teacher(s) max hours daily, whenever it is possible. For instance, if you "
		"know that year 5 will only have hours from 8:00 to 13:00, it is better to add students set not available in addition to students "

		"For extreme cases, the timetable generation might be longer or much longer than it should be. These cases refer to "
		"situations in which the total duration of the activities with the specified activity tag of the ATS is high compared to the "
		"total number of hours of all activities of the ATS, combined with other conditions you have in the data."
		" If the ratio of duration of activities with this activity tag of the ATS over the total duration of activities of the ATS"

		"2) Then, you lock A2, A3, A4 and A5 and try to generate again. In some cases m-FET will report impossible activity A1.\n"
		"3) If you lock A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5, m-FET will be able to find a timetable very fast.\n\n"
		"1) Why can m-FET schedule the timetable the first time? Because in some cases m-FET will be able to break one-by-one all the 4 constraints max hours daily for A2, A3, A4 and A5 "
		"(no activity is locked, so it may try more times to place/replace the activities, and it will find a way to put A1, then put the rest of the activities).\n\n"
		"2) Why sometimes m-FET cannot schedule the timetable the second time (with locked A2, A3, A4 and A5)? "
		"Because: A2, A3, A4 and A5 are locked and are scheduled firstly. Then m-FET tries to put A1. But to put A1, it means "
		"to break a 95% constraint 4 times, because there are 4 students sets in A1. Weight 95% 4 times in a row is equivalent with a constraint with weight "
