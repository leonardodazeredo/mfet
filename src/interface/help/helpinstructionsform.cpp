		"another day between them). It is recommended that when inputting activities which are split into only 2 subactivities per week, "

		"timetable in the end, so the weight is subjective. So, the best way would be to choose a 99.75% for all constraints, "
		"but the time of generation might be larger than with 95%. You could try at first the 95% minimum recommended value, then "
